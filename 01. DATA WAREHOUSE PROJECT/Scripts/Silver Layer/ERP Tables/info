In this folder in all the 3 ERP scripts I did all the modification, cleaning of the data from the bronze layer tables
and then I applied the INSERT INTO step to popolate the tables in the silver layer.

So each script follows this path :
- List of cleansing to with analysis, test and solution

- Each cleansing contains in the query also the previous cleansing:
    for example step 1 remove duplicates --> query to remove duplicates
                step 2 handle missing values --> query to handle missing values + remove duplicates
                step 3 standardization --> query stardadization +  handle missing values + remove duplicates
    This allows to have in the last step the complete query with all the modification

- INSERT INTO command with the last query
