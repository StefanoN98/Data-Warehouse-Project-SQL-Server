# SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project
Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modeling and analytics

📊 Data Warehouse Project with SQL Server

📝 Overview

This project focuses on building a Data Warehouse (DWH) using SQL Server, implementing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to handle structured data from various sources. The architecture follows the Medallion approach (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers) to ensure data is efficiently ingested, cleaned, transformed, and optimized for analytical consumption.

🏗 Architecture

The project adheres to the Medallion Architecture, which consists of three layers:

🟤 1. Bronze Layer (Raw Data)

📂 Stores raw data as received from source systems (CRM, ERP) in CSV format.

❌ No transformation is applied.

📌 Data is loaded using batch processing with full load and truncate & insert strategies.

📊 Object Type: Tables.

⚪ 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned, Standardized Data)

🧹 Cleanses and standardizes raw data for consistency and quality.

🔍 Performs data cleansing, normalization, derived columns, and enrichment.

📌 Data is still stored in tables.

⚙ Uses batch processing for loading.

🟡 3. Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data)

💡 Provides transformed data optimized for analytics and reporting.

🔄 Applies data integration, aggregation, and business logic.

📌 Data is stored as views rather than tables.

📊 Supports multiple data models:

🌟 Star Schema

📑 Flat Table

📈 Aggregated Table

🔄 Data Flow

📥 Extract: Data is ingested from CSV files located in designated folders.

🔄 Transform:

🟤 Bronze: No transformation (raw data storage).

⚪ Silver: Cleansing, standardization, and enrichment.

🟡 Gold: Aggregations and business logic applied.

📤 Load:

🟤 Bronze and ⚪ Silver layers use batch processing.

🟡 Gold layer uses views for optimized data retrieval.

🛠 Technologies Used

🗄 SQL Server for data storage and processing.

🔀 SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) for ETL workflows.

📊 Power BI / Reporting Tools for business intelligence.

📜 SQL Queries for ad hoc analysis.

🐍 Python / Pandas (Optional) for additional data processing.

🚀 How to Run the Project

🏗 Set Up SQL Server: Install SQL Server and create the necessary databases.

📂 Load Data: Place CSV files into the designated source folder.

🔄 Execute ETL Processes: Run SQL scripts or SSIS packages to populate the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

📊 Consume Data: Use Power BI, SQL queries, or ML models for insights.

🌟 Future Enhancements

🤖 Automate ETL pipeline using SQL Server Agent.

☁ Integrate cloud storage for scalability.

⚡ Implement real-time streaming for incremental data updates.
